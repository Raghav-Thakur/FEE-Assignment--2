                her true identity, has been described as "otherworldly." She will appear in public for the first time at

                closely, and the Straw Hats led by Luffy who simply came to enjoy her sonorous performance - the voice
                that the whole world has been waiting for is about to resound. The story begins with the shocking fact
                that she is "Shanks' daughter."</p>
